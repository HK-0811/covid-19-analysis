This project showcases end-to-end data analysis of COVID-19 datasets sourced from multiple platforms (MySQL, PostgreSQL, and S3). Using AWS Glue Data was combined into one dataset and analyzed using Databricks and PySpark to uncover trends and insights. Key tasks include data aggregation, calculating moving averages, visualizing state-wise distributions, and generating growth metrics for cases and deaths. Interactive visualizations were created using Plotly to comprehensively view the pandemic's impact.
